# Security Policy

## Supported versions

spectra6 is pre-1.0. No 0.x release receives security fixes or advisories; fixes land in the next
release line. Security support starts with 1.0.

| Version | Security fixes |
|---------|----------------|
| < 1.0   | No             |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please don't open a public issue for a security problem.

Report it privately through GitHub: the **Report a vulnerability** button on this repository's
**Security** tab. If that isn't available, email **info@projectsaturnstudios.com**.

Include what you found, the affected version, the adapter and hardware in use, and steps to
reproduce. Reports are read and weighed for the release line in development; before 1.0 there is
no response-time commitment.

## Security model

spectra6 is plain PHP. It writes Spectra6 commands and image data through the bus and pin
transports `scrapyard-io/framework` hands it, and holds no native code of its own. What a PHP
process may touch is decided below it: the adapter (`microscrap/scrapyard-linux` over ext-posi,
`microscrap/scrapyard-usb` over ext-ftdi) and the operating system's permissions on the SPI, GPIO
or USB device. Grant those through device groups or udev rules scoped to the hardware, not by
running PHP as root.

- **Configuration is trusted input.** `conjure()` connects whatever bus, chip select and DC, RST,
  BUSY and PWR pins the `circuits.spectra6` config names, and drives DC, RST and PWR as
  outputs. Keep that config under the app's control: a wrong pin number drives
  another device's line.
- **Writes and waits are bounded.** Register fields out of range throw before anything is written,
  frames are checked against the panel, a refused or short bus write throws, and every BUSY wait
  ends in a timeout.
- **Image bytes are not validated.** `transmit()` sends the bytes it is given; the panel shows them.

A report is in scope when this package writes a command or bus frame it was not asked to, drives a
pin other than its configured DC, RST and PWR, or lets a well-formed call leave the controller in a
state its configuration does not describe. Weaknesses in an adapter or extension belong to that
package's own policy.
